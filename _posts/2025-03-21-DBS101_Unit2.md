# Unit 2: Entity-Relationship Model and Relational Schema

![ERD](/assets/lib/unit2/pic1.png)

After completing Unit 1, I was excited to dive deeper into the world of databases. Unit 2 introduced me to the **Entity-Relationship Model (ERD)** and **Relational Schema**, and it was a game-changer for my understanding of how databases are designed and structured. Let me take you through my journey of learning and how it transformed my perspective.

## Previous Understanding of ERD and Relational Schema

Before starting this unit, I had a vague idea of what an ERD was. I thought it was just a fancy diagram that showed how tables were connected in a database. I didn’t realize how crucial it was for designing a database or how it could help in visualizing relationships between different entities. As for relational schema, I had no clue what it was or how it worked. I thought it was just another term for a database table.

## Key Learnings from Unit 2

### **Entity-Relationship Model (ERD)**

The ERD is like the blueprint of a database. It helps us visualize the structure of the database by showing the entities (tables), their attributes (columns), and the relationships between them. Here’s what I learned:

1. **Entities**: These are the "things" or objects in the real world that we want to store data about. For example, in a university database, entities could be **Student**, **Course**, or **Instructor**.
   
2. **Attributes**: These are the properties or details of an entity. For example, a **Student** entity might have attributes like **StudentID**, **Name**, and **Address**.

3. **Relationships**: These show how entities are connected. For example, a **Student** enrolls in a **Course**, and an **Instructor** teaches a **Course**.

4. **Cardinality**: This defines the number of relationships between entities. For example, one student can enroll in many courses, and one course can have many students (many-to-many relationship).

### **Relational Schema**

The relational schema is the actual implementation of the ERD in a database. It defines the structure of the database, including tables, columns, and relationships. Here’s what I learned:

1. **Tables**: Each entity in the ERD becomes a table in the relational schema. For example, the **Student** entity becomes a **Student** table.

2. **Primary Keys**: These are unique identifiers for each row in a table. For example, **StudentID** would be the primary key for the **Student** table.

3. **Foreign Keys**: These are used to create relationships between tables. For example, the **Course** table might have a **StudentID** as a foreign key to link it to the **Student** table.

4. **Normalization**: This is the process of organizing the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. I learned about the different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and how they help in designing efficient databases.

### **Mapping ERD to Relational Schema**

One of the most interesting parts of this unit was learning how to convert an ERD into a relational schema. Here’s how it works:

1. **Entities to Tables**: Each entity in the ERD becomes a table in the relational schema.
   
2. **Attributes to Columns**: The attributes of an entity become the columns of the table.

3. **Relationships to Foreign Keys**: Relationships between entities are represented using foreign keys in the tables.

4. **Handling Complex Relationships**: For many-to-many relationships, a new table (junction table) is created to handle the relationship.

### **Types of Relationships**

I also learned about the different types of relationships in databases:

1. **One-to-One**: For example, one student has one student ID.
   
2. **One-to-Many**: For example, one instructor teaches many courses.

3. **Many-to-Many**: For example, many students enroll in many courses.

###  Reducing E-R Diagrams to Relational Schemas
 1. Create a table for each entity type.- All single valued attribute becomes a column for 
the table.- Primary key attribute of entity → Primary key of 
table.

 2. Multivalued attribute is represented by a separate 
table.

 3. For composite attributes, only the sub attributes 
are made into columns of the table.

 4. Derived attributes are not made into columns.

###  Relational Query Languages
 1. Imperative query language: user gives specific 
instructions.

 2. Functional query language: input is given as evaluation 
of functions that may operate on data in the database.

3. Declarative query language: the user describes the 
desired information without giving a specific sequence 
of steps or function calls for obtaining that 
information.

### Relational Algebra

We explored relational algebra, which is a formal system for working with relations (tables) in a database. It includes operations like selection, projection, union, intersection, and join. These operations are key to understanding SQL queries, making them an essential topic.

Here’s a different example of relational algebra operations:

Selection: σ (Salary > "50000") (Employee)

This selects all rows from the Employee table where the Salary is greater than "50,000."

Projection: Π (FirstName, JobTitle) (Employee)

This projects only the FirstName and JobTitle columns from the Employee table.

### **Comparison of Previous and Current Understanding**

Before this unit, I thought ERDs were just simple diagrams, and relational schema was just a fancy term for tables. Now, I understand that ERDs are essential for designing a database, and relational schema is the actual implementation of that design. I also learned how to map an ERD to a relational schema, which is a crucial skill for database design.

### **Conclusion**

This unit has been an eye-opener for me. I now understand the importance of ERDs and relational schema in designing efficient and effective databases. I’m excited to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios and continue learning more about database systems.

### **Reflection**

This unit has been so rewarding for me. I started with only a basic idea of ERDs and relational schema, but now I can design and use them confidently. I'm excited to learn more about database systems in the next units and to use these ideas in real-life projects.
