## Topic: Data users and Administration
Before learning this unit, I had limited knowledge about data, knowing only that it was raw information that could have a predefined structure or be unstructured. After going through Unit 1, I have learned the following:

Data: A collection of sets of information.

Database: A structured collection of data. Example: It stores customers' names, orders, and addresses.

Database Management System (DBMS): Software that provides an interface for managing and interacting with the database. Example: It ensures data security (only authorized users) and data integrity (accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle).

Database System: The complete system that includes both the database (the data) and the DBMS (the software to manage the data). Database systems offer a structured and efficient way to manage data, ensuring it remains consistent, secure, and accessible to authorized users.

Data Model: A set of ideas and tools used to describe and organize data, how data items relate to each other, what the data means, and the rules to ensure the data is correct and consistent.
