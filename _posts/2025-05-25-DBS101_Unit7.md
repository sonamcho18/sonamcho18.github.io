# Unit 7: Transaction Management and Concurrency Control in Database Systems

## Introduction

After learning the fundamentals of indexing and query optimization in Unit 6, I was excited to view into the world of transaction management and concurrency control in Unit 7. This unit provided a comprehensive understanding of how databases maintain consistency and integrity when multiple transactions occur simultaneously. Here's a detailed account of my learning journey.

## Previous Understanding of Transactions and Concurrency

Before this unit, my knowledge of transactions was limited to the basic idea of "all-or-nothing" operations. I understood that transactions either fully complete or have no effect at all, but I didn't grasp the mechanisms behind this guarantee. Concurrency control was a complete black box, I assumed databases somehow handled multiple users without issues, but I had no idea how they prevented problems like lost updates or inconsistent reads.

## Key Learnings from Unit 7

### Transaction Concepts
- **Definition**: A transaction is a logical unit of work that accesses and possibly updates data items in a database.
- **ACID Properties**:
  - **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction are completed successfully, or none are.
  - **Consistency**: A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
  - **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other.
  - **Durability**: Once committed, changes persist even after system failures.

### Transaction States
- **Active**: The initial state where the transaction is executing.
- **Partially Committed**: After the final operation is executed.
- **Failed**: If normal execution can no longer proceed.
- **Aborted**: After the transaction has been rolled back.
- **Committed**: After successful completion.

### Concurrency Control
- **Problems with Uncontrolled Concurrency**:
  - **Lost Update**: Two transactions update the same data item, and one overwrites the other's change.
  - **Dirty Read**: A transaction reads data written by an uncommitted transaction.
  - **Non-repeatable Read**: A transaction reads the same data item twice but gets different values.
  - **Phantom Read**: A transaction re-executes a query and sees new rows inserted by another transaction.

### Lock-Based Protocols
- **Shared (S) Locks**: Allow multiple transactions to read a data item simultaneously.
- **Exclusive (X) Locks**: Allow a transaction to both read and write a data item exclusively.
- **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**:
  - **Growing Phase**: A transaction can acquire locks but cannot release any.
  - **Shrinking Phase**: A transaction can release locks but cannot acquire any new ones.
- **Lock Compatibility Matrix**: Determines whether a lock request can be granted based on existing locks.

### Deadlocks
- **Definition**: A cycle of transactions waiting for locks held by each other.
- **Handling Techniques**:
  - **Deadlock Detection**: Using a waits-for graph to identify cycles.
  - **Deadlock Prevention**: Assigning priorities based on timestamps (Wait-Die and Wound-Wait schemes).

### Timestamp-Based Protocols
- **Basic Timestamp Ordering**: Uses timestamps to order transactions and ensure serializability.
- **Thomas Write Rule**: Allows certain write operations to proceed without aborting transactions, improving efficiency.

### Recovery Systems
- **Log-Based Recovery**: Uses a log to record all database modifications for recovery purposes.
- **Checkpoints**: Periodic snapshots of the database state to limit the amount of log processed during recovery.
- **ARIES Algorithm**: A sophisticated recovery algorithm that uses three passes (analysis, redo, undo) to recover from crashes.

## Comparison of Previous and Current Understanding

Before this unit, I thought transactions were simple sequences of operations with basic commit/rollback functionality. Now, I understand the intricate mechanisms that ensure ACID properties, especially under concurrent execution. I also had no idea about the variety of concurrency control protocols (locking, timestamp ordering, etc.) and how they balance performance with correctness.

## Practical Applications

### Implementing Transactions in SQL
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

### Analyzing Locking Behavior
Used PostgreSQL's `pg_locks` view to monitor locks:
```sql
SELECT locktype, relation::regclass, mode, transactionid AS tid, virtualtransaction AS vtid, pid, granted
FROM pg_locks;
```

### Testing Isolation Levels
Explored different isolation levels and their effects:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
-- Observe behavior with concurrent updates
COMMIT;
```


### Lock Compatibility Matrix
Constructed a matrix showing compatibility between shared and exclusive locks.

|          | S (Shared) | X (Exclusive) |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| S        | Compatible | Not Compatible|
| X        | Not Compatible | Not Compatible|

### Deadlock Scenario Analysis
Analyzed a deadlock scenario involving two transactions and proposed solutions using Wait-Die and Wound-Wait schemes.

## Conclusion

Unit 7 has been eye-opening, revealing the complex yet elegant mechanisms databases use to handle transactions and concurrency. From the ACID properties to advanced recovery techniques like ARIES, I now appreciate how databases maintain consistency and durability even in the face of failures. These concepts are crucial for building robust, high-performance applications, and I'm eager to apply them in real-world scenarios.

## Reflection

This unit has transformed my understanding of database internals. What once seemed like magic how databases handle multiple users and recover from crashes but now makes logical sense. The balance between correctness (serializability) and performance (concurrency) is particularly fascinating. I look forward to exploring more advanced topics in distributed transactions and multi-version concurrency control in future studies.
