# Unit 6: Indexing, Query Processing, and Optimization in Database Systems


After completing the foundational units on database design and the Entity-Relationship Model, I was eager to explore how databases efficiently retrieve and process data. Unit 6, covering **Indexing, Query Processing, and Optimization**, provided deep insights into these critical aspects. Here's a detailed account of my learning journey.

## Previous Understanding of Indexing and Query Processing

Before this unit:
- Thought indexes were simple lookup tables
- Assumed databases magically fetched data without understanding the process
- Considered optimization as something only DBAs worried about

## Key Learnings from Unit 6

### **Indexing**
Indexes are like the table of contents in a book—they help the database quickly locate data.

#### Types of Indexes:
1. **Ordered Indices**: Values stored in sorted order
2. **Hashed Indices**: Uses hash functions to distribute values
3. **Dense vs. Sparse**:
   - Dense: Entry for every search key
   - Sparse: Entries only for some keys

#### B-Tree Family:
- **B-Tree**: Self-balancing tree with multiple keys/children per node
- **B+ Tree**: Only leaf nodes store data pointers (ideal for range queries)

#### Multilevel Indexing:
- Used when indexes don't fit in memory
- Outer index (memory) points to inner index blocks (disk)

### **Query Processing**
Three main steps:

1. **Parsing and Translation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000 → σ_salary>50000(employees)
   ```
2. **Optimization**:

Evaluates multiple execution plans

Uses pipelining/materialization techniques

3. **Evaluation**:

Executes chosen plan via query engine

### **Query Optimization**
Key concepts:

Cost Estimation:

Based on disk I/O, CPU, memory

Example: Join costs vary by algorithm (nested loop vs hash join)

Transformation Rules:

Commutative property: σ_θ1(σ_θ2(E)) ≡ σ_θ2(σ_θ1(E))

Join commutativity: E1 ⋈ E2 ≡ E2 ⋈ E1

Join Ordering:

Uses dynamic programming

Example: (R JOIN S) JOIN T often better than (S JOIN T) JOIN R

###  Practical Application 
Creating Indexes
``` sql
-- Dense index
CREATE INDEX employees_idx ON employees (emp_id);

-- Sparse index  
CREATE INDEX employees_sparse_idx ON employees (salary) WITH (fillfactor=100);
```
Analyzing Queries
``` sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_id = 12345;
```

## Conclusion
This unit transformed my understanding of:

- How indexes actually work (B+ Trees are brilliant!)

- The systematic process behind query execution

- The science of optimization beyond "magic"

These skills are directly applicable to building high-performance databases.

## Reflection
From clueless about query plans to:

- Confidently creating optimal indexes

- Understanding execution paths

- Calculating operation costs

Excited to apply these in real projects and continue learning.
